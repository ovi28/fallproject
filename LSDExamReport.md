### 2. Maintenance and SLA status
The person operating the other group is Rumyana. She, in the role of an operator was responsible for ensuring the system of other group was running properly in the period 12/04/2017 – 12/15/2017.
## 2.1. Hand-over
The other group handed over to us a link to their Github repository, containing their source code and a “README.md” file, which presumably contained the technical documentation for their system. This file describe the 3 conceptual parts of their system, how to access their virtual system environment (droplet), how to get permission to operate the system, a description of their API routes, how to report an issue and a link to their monitoring system (Grafana dashboard).  
Let’s discuss the content of the documentation. The system overview was too short as it contains of only one sentence: “This is a clone application of the website HackerNews”. [1] 
I think it should also explain the functionalities of system. Next, a brief description of the system architecture describes the three running components of the system and their web addresses. I was also informed of how to gain access to the system administration and the database, and how to start and stop the application. This gives me ability to control the application from within. I couldn’t find a description of the data flow within the system, but from the system architecture I figured that the back-end manipulates the data from the database and presumably contain the API. Unfortunately the website is not described at all, neither are the web pages or the functionality of it. This is not acceptable because font-end is one of the three main components of the system. The API on the other hand is described well, the only things missing are the format and structure of data that the “/post”, used to post a new post, and “/user” to post a new user. During the maintenance process we discovered that the routes are wrong and some of them were missing. Finally it says to “contact one of the team members” [1] in case of something happening, but it’s not described how to contact them. I figured one way to do so is post a Github Issue [2] on their repository and another to talk to them in person.  
In conclusion the documentation contained enough information to understand how to operate two of the systems and react on errors. It was lacking a description of one of the system components and some more information on one of the other components. I partially prepared to maintain the system. 
## 2.2. Service-level agreement
After that we set up a service-level agreement. This agreement look like this: 
“This Service-level Agreement (SLA) will define the contract that we, the service provider, will try to guarantee at all times to you, the client. We describe an agreement that we have set in order to have a service that meets all expectations. We set the expected up time of the service, response times and status as well as explain how we calculate the metrics.
Uptime
Our services minimum expected up time is set at 95% per month. This means that the website Hacker News will be at a minimum 95% of the month. The way in which we calculate the percentage of up-time of the service is by taking the number of minutes in the month and comparing the minutes of up-time we have had that month.
Response time
Our service will have a maximum response time of 100 milliseconds. This metric is calculated with the help of an external service, Prometheus. Prometheus will store the response time of all requests sent to our server and the time it takes the server to respond to the client, from this we will be able to see if any request surpasses a response time of 60 milliseconds. This of course is subjective depending on whether the client internet connection is strong. If the client internet connection is by any means deemed to be not of adequate speed this agreement can be acquitted.”
From the documentation we received it’s clear we can monitor the two metrics we agreed upon. They can be accessed from the link to their Grafana dashboard.
## 2.3. Maintenance and reliability
I, Rumyana as a system operator was responsible for the maintenance process. First I contacted the other group members to address the communication issue. Together we verbally agreed to address any issues on their Github repository as I presumed. Additionally we can contact them via their profiles on Facebook. Additionally they described the website functionalities. 
Second I tested all of the system functionalities. Starting with trying the website functionalities by visiting the website. I was able to view a list of posts on their front page, register and log in via a separate page, upload a post as a user. All of the pages contain a green navigation bar on top with makes it easy to browse through the website. In general everything seems in place. 
I continued to testing the API. After following the description provided in the documentation it became clear that some of the URLs were not correct. I contacted the team via their Github repository using Github Issues [2] by reporting two of the mistaken URLs: the post a new post and post a new user. Additionally I mentioned the lack of description on the format of the POST body for posting a new story. After just two hours the group has fixed the issue by specifying the format and updating the README with the correct URLs.
For testing the API I used Advanced REST Client [3] chrome extension. I began by posting a couple of posts as JSON files in the specified format. These posts examples were taken from a tester program made specifically to test the system’s API [4]. On some of the POSTs the system responded with a code 200 but with a message body containing hat seemed to be a SQL error message.

I contacted the group via Github by posting a Github Issue. The reported issue was fixed by changing the SQL table’s row type “from using varchar(45) to varchar(200)” [5]. After consulting with the mandatory requirements [6] I found that “http://146.185.141.49:8081/latest” was not recorded in the technical documentation they provided, this issue was not reported. I continued with checking the “latest digested post” by submitting a post with a “hanesst_id:42” I was able to retrieve the latest digested post and confirmed it was the same. The system also provided it’s status when requested on “/status”.
Finally I checked the metrics specified in the SLA. I did so by comparing the expected metrics from the SLA and the recorded metrics from Grafana dashboard.
The defined response time should be a maximum of 100 milliseconds. The recorded metrics show that for the majority of requests the response time has indeed stayed under 100 milliseconds with a few exceptions. On the 07/12 and 12/12 the system exceed the limit, but as stated in the SLA “This of course is subjective depending on whether the client internet connection is strong.” [7] This is the reason these two issues were not reported.
The system uptime agreement was completely upheld as the recorded uptime is 99.28237192825749% and the expected was 95%. This metrics is recorded by running this query on their Grafana dashboard “avg_over_time(up{job='backend'}[30d]) * 100”.
In conclusion I can say that the developers responded to all reported issues. There was a slight delay with responding to the problem with “/post” route, but since there was no stated respond time in the SLA we cannot hold them responsible. The system have an excellent uptime and good response time with two minor fluctuations. I think the system is reliable in general since I consider the SLA agreement has been kept and all of the issues addressed. 
### 3. Discussion
The maintenance process went smooth considering the lack of some information in the initial hand-in. It would have been much better if the developers had put more effort in describing the system’s functionality. This would have given me more guidance when testing the system and also tracing the issues I encountered. It’s also very important to ensure the feedback channels are clearly stated. I made a lot of presumptions about that. I consider as my mistake not requesting to rewrite the service level agreement when I first encountered this error and the consequences were shown later when the developers were late with responding to some of the issues.
